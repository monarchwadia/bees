Bee is now being created via LLM.

Now, we need a window chat agent which can do function calling on demand.

Controls and state probably need to have 2-way binding of some sort.

I think I'm happy with the game & where it is now.

I want to install https://webllm.mlc.ai/ and use it to control the game.

Sim params can now be controlled via slider. And, the LLM can now successfully follow instructions for adding ants.

After talking to Yeshe i should probably rename from bees to ants.
